# Ocean Hazard Reporting & Monitoring Platform

### Built with support from INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services)

---

## About INCOIS
The **Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)**, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, provides critical ocean information and advisory services to support **disaster risk reduction** and ensure **maritime safety** for coastal stakeholders.  
Its early warning systems cover hazards such as:
- Tsunamis
- Storm surges
- High waves
- Swell surges
- Coastal currents  

These services enable authorities and communities to take informed decisions during ocean-related emergencies.

## Background
Indiaâ€™s 7,500+ km coastline is **highly vulnerable** to ocean hazards like tsunamis, storm surges, unusual sea-level changes, and erosion.  
While INCOIS provides early warnings using **satellite data, sensors, and models**, two major challenges exist:
1. **Real-time field reporting** from citizens and communities is often **delayed or missing**.  
2. **Public discussions on social media** during hazard events remain **untapped**, even though they provide crucial insights into ground realities and awareness.  

---

## Project Vision
A **unified crowdsourcing platform** where:
- **Citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers** can report live observations (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, coastal damage).  
- **Social media streams** are analyzed for hazard-related discussions.  
- Data is **visualized on a dynamic dashboard**, helping **emergency agencies** validate models, detect misinformation, and respond faster.

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Citizen Engagement
- Submit **geotagged hazard reports** with photos/videos via mobile/web.
- **Voice-based** & **multilingual reporting** for accessibility.
- **Offline reporting** â†’ syncs automatically when back online.

### ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Dashboard
- Interactive **map with hotspots**, dynamically generated by:
  - Report density
  - Verified incidents
  - Keyword frequency in social media
- **Safe zones** & **evacuation points** visualized in real time.
- **Trend charts** of hazards by type & location.

### ðŸ”¹ Crisis Management
- **Crisis Room Chats** for structured discussions between citizens, authorities, and analysts.
- **High-priority filtering** â†’ most urgent areas highlighted first.
- Browser & mobile **push notifications** for alerts.

### ðŸ”¹ Social Media Integration
- Collect public data from **Twitter, Facebook, YouTube**, etc.
- **NLP-powered classification**:
  - Extract hazard-related keywords
  - Detect sentiment & urgency
  - **AI-based rumor/misinformation detection**

### ðŸ”¹ Post-Disaster Analytics
- Incident history for **preparedness & resilience planning**.
- Aggregated insights for **policy & scientific research**.

---

## Innovations
- **Unified crowdsourcing + social media monitoring** in one platform.  
- **Crisis Rooms** for structured real-time collaboration.  
- **AI-powered rumor detection** for reliability.  
- **Offline-ready system** to support low-connectivity coastal regions.  
- **Ground-level empowerment** with tools for both citizens & staff.  

---

## Expected Solution Architecture
- **Frontend:** Web + Mobile app (report submission, live dashboard).  
- **Backend:** API & database for report storage, integration with INCOIS early warning systems.  
- **Data Processing:** NLP engine for hazard-related post classification, keyword trends, and misinformation checks.  
- **Visualization:** Map layers, report hotspots, safe zones, charts.  
- **Accessibility:** Multilingual + offline-first design.  

---

## Getting Started (Demo Mode)
The project includes a **frontend-only demo** (`app.js`) showcasing:
- Report submission & visualization  
- Hotspot clustering  
- Crisis room chat  
- CSV export of reports  
- Social feed simulation  
- Priority alerts with browser notifications  

ðŸ‘‰ For backend integration, APIs and databases must be set up for:
- User management  
- Report persistence  
- Social media ingestion  
- Analytics engine  

---

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Full backend integration with INCOIS data pipelines  
- [ ] Real-time satellite/sensor data overlay  
- [ ] Mobile app with offline-first syncing  
- [ ] Multilingual UI (major Indian coastal languages)  
- [ ] Machine learning models for hazard prediction
